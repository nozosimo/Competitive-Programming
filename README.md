## **Competitive Programming**

> This repository consists of several solutions of online judges. All algorithms in this repository are from my time in high school. Camps, OBI ([Bolivian Olympiad in Informatics](http://olimpiada.icpc-bolivia.edu.bo/)) and practices.  It contains some algorithms that I use / know and solutions of some online judges.

**You are free to see them, use them, learn. (You're free!)**

1. If you have questions, ask. Maybe we can have coffee and talk about the algorithms.
2. If there are errors correct it using comments so that other users understand the changes. (be explicit).

>**- Why is it open source?**
>
>**- Because I think students, like me, do not always have someone explain their problems to them.  Part of my learning is based on reading other people's codes and try to understand them.**
