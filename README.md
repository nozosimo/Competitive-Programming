#Competitive Programming

All algorithms in this repository are from my time in high school. Camps, OBI (Bolivian Olympiad in Informatics) and practices.  It contains some algorithms that I use / know and solutions of some online judges (Uva, Uri).

You are free to see them, use them, learn. (Its free!) :D

>If you have questions, ask. Maybe we can have coffee and talk about the algorithms.
>If there are errors correct it using comments so that other users understand the changes. (be explicit).
