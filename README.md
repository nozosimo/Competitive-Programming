## **Competitive Programming**

> This repository consists of several solutions of online judges. All algorithms in this repository are from my time in high school. Camps, OBI ([Bolivian Olympiad in Informatics](http://olimpiada.icpc-bolivia.edu.bo/)) and practices.  It contains some algorithms that I use / know and solutions of some online judges.

**Of course you are free to use them.**

(If you have questions, ask me. Maybe we can have coffee and talk about the algorithms.)
